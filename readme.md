## 🚀 Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

1. **Start the backend API**

```powershell
cd d:/Learning/Efootball/backend
npm install
npm start
```

The backend will run on http://localhost:4000

2. **Start the frontend dev server**

```powershell
cd d:/Learning/Efootball/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend dev server runs on http://localhost:5173 by default and proxies API calls to the backend.

## 🎯 Build publishable frontend files

To produce publishable static files with the gaming-themed UI:

```powershell
cd d:/Learning/Efootball/frontend
npm run build
```

## 🔌 Backend endpoints

The backend implements the following REST endpoints with MySQL/SQLite persistence:

- POST `/api/players` — create a new player
- POST `/api/tournaments` — create a new tournament  
- GET `/api/tournaments` — list tournaments with players and matches
- POST `/api/tournaments/:id/players` — add player to tournament
- POST `/api/tournaments/:id/generate-matches` — generate round-robin + knockout matches
- PUT `/api/matches/:id/score` — input match result (returns winner for finals)
- GET `/api/tournaments/:id/standings` — computed standings with goal stats
- GET `/api/tournaments/:id/winner` — tournament winner if completed

All data persists in SQLite by default (with MySQL fallback support).
